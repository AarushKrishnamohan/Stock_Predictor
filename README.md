## What is the Project?
The Stock Predictor is an innovative project aimed at forecasting stock market prices using machine learning and statistical analysis. My goal is to leverage historical data, financial indicators, and market sentiment to generate predictions on S&P 500 stock price movements. This project is designed for educational purposes and to showcase the potential of data science and machine learning in financial analysis.
